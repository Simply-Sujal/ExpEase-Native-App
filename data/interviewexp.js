        experienceDetails: "The interview process was comprehensive, focusing heavily on data structures and algorithms. It began with a brief introduction where the interviewer asked about my background and academic journey. The initial questions were centered around my understanding of basic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and stacks. I was asked to explain how these structures work and where they could be applied in real-world scenarios.As the interview progressed, I was presented with coding challenges that tested my problem-solving skills. I had to implement algorithms for sorting, searching, and manipulating data. One of the questions involved optimizing a solution using dynamic programming, which was a bit tricky but rewarding once I figured it out. The panel was highly interactive, providing hints and feedback as needed, which helped me stay on track.The interview also included some theoretical questions where I had to explain the time and space complexity of different algorithms. This part of the interview tested my understanding of algorithm efficiency, and I was asked to compare different approaches to solving the same problem.The panel was very supportive throughout the process, offering valuable insights and asking clarifying questions. They seemed genuinely interested in understanding my thought process rather than just focusing on getting the right answer. After the technical rounds, there was a brief discussion about my approach to teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving in real-world projects.Overall, it was a challenging yet rewarding experience, and the interviewers created a comfortable environment that allowed me to showcase my skills and learn from the process.",
